            <p>Welcome to the page for my new book project, tentatively titled "The Lives of Books: Readers and Their Books Across Time." This project explores the rich and often unexpected relationships between readers and their books, from marginalia and annotations to acts of preservation and destruction. It delves into the ways we make books our own and how these interactions shape both the physical object and its cultural significance.</p>

            <h2>What's Inside</h2>
            <p>This book will take readers on a journey through the history of reading, examining diverse examples of readerly engagement. From medieval monks annotating manuscripts to contemporary book collectors and the digital traces of e-reading, each chapter will illuminate the dynamic interplay between individuals and the texts they encounter. Topics will include the social life of books, the materiality of reading, the impact of technology on reading practices, and the enduring power of books as objects of personal and cultural meaning.</p>
