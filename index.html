      <p>
        I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Darden School of Business, University of Virginia, where my research focuses on the dynamics of Stakeholder Theory, particularly in developing countries. I employ qualitative methodologies, such as case study analysis and grounded theory, to explore how organizations engage with their stakeholders in diverse contexts.

        I have published a paper on "Creating Shared Value" in the International Journal of Management Reviews, which was Wiley’s top-cited and most downloaded article for 2021-2022. In 2019, I received the Best Ph.D. Student Paper Award at the World Open Innovation Conference. I hold a Ph.D. in Management from Luiss Guido Carli University, where I also completed a research fellowship. During my Ph.D., I was a visiting scholar at Boston College, where I worked closely with Professor Michael Pratt to hone my qualitative research skills.

        My academic journey also includes a master’s degree in Business Management from La Sapienza University in Rome and an Erasmus program at Södertörn University in Stockholm. My research interests center on organizational purpose, stakeholder engagement, and crisis management. I am passionate about advancing scholarship that bridges theory and practice in these areas.</p>
        <p>
            I have also contributed to various international academic and professional networks, including working as an adviser on internationalization and exchange programs and presiding over the Sapienza University Chapter of European Horizons.
