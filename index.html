                        My research focuses on purpose, stakeholder identification, and the dynamics of stakeholder
                        theory in crisis situations. It is primarily phenomenon-driven, and I employ qualitative
                        methodologies such as case study analysis and the grounded theory approach.

                    <p>
                        I have published a paper on Creating Shared Value in the International Journal of Management
                        Reviews, which was Wiley’s top-cited and most downloaded article of the year (2021–2022).
                        Additionally, I received the Best PhD Student Paper Award at the World Open Innovation
                        Conference 2019 and the People’s Choice Award at the Postdoc Symposium 2024 at the University of
                        Virginia.

                    <p>
                        I hold a Ph.D. in Management from Luiss Guido Carli University, during which I was a visiting
                        Ph.D. researcher at Boston College. I also earned a master’s degree in Business Management from
                        La Sapienza University in Rome and completed an Erasmus program at Södertörn University in
                        Stockholm.

                        I am passionate about advancing scholarship and practice in organizational purpose and
                        Stakeholder Theory.
