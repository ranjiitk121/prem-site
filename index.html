      <p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
      <p>Much of my work focuses on the consequences of women’s political representation. This includes how the adoption of electoral gender quotas shapes the substantive representation of women’s interests in national legislatures and how exposure to women officeholders affects citizen behavior. My current research examines questions related to gender and climate governance, including a book project that examines the origins of gender differences in climate attitudes worldwide.</p>
      <p>My work has appeared in the American Political Science Review, American Journal of Political Science, Journal of Politics, and International Organization among other outlets. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the American Association of University Women (AAUW), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) research group. I have also consulted for the World Bank (Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network, Africa Region), USAID (Women’s Political Participation and Leadership Program), and the OECD (Public Governance Directorate). I am a founding member of EGEN and an active member of EGAP.</p>
